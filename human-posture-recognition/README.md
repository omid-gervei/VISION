Human Body Pose Estimation (HBPE) and Human Body Posture Recognition(HBPR) have improved significantly in the past decade. Gaining access to huge amounts of data, Kinect camera, neural networks and specifically deep convolutional neural networks (deep convnets) have led to fascinating success in these fields. In this paper we propose an ensemble model for human body posture recognition. Deep convnets are the main building block and fundamental aspect of our proposed model. We leverage deep convnets in two variations to classify postures.
